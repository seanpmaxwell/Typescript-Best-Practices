## 🧭 Philosophy 

This guide favors:

- Explicitness over cleverness  
- Simplicity over abstraction  
- Consistency over novelty  

It is designed to scale with real-world TypeScript applications.

<a id="terminology"></a>
## 🔠 Terminology

So things are more clear down the line let's first clarify some terminology.

### Objects states
- Objects can be **static**, **readonly**, or **dynamic**.
  - **static:** values can change but not keys (default for TypeScript)
  - **dynamic:** keys and values can change (default for JavaScript)
  - **readonly:** neither keys or values can change (typically done with `as const`)
 
### Functions
- **embedded-functions:** functions declared in object literals
- **validator-functions:** accept and unknown variable and return a type-predicate

<br/><b>***</b><br/>

<a id="fundamental-concepts"></a>
## 💡 Fundamental Concepts

This guide revolves around four fundamental language features:

- **Primitives**
- **Functions**
- **Objects**
- **Types**

These concepts form the foundation of all JavaScript and TypeScript programs. Mastering them—and using them consistently—results in code that is easier to read, reason about, and maintain.

<a id="script-types"></a>
## 📄 Script Types

Every file should have a clear purpose. Most scripts fall into one of the following categories:

- **Declaration**  
  Exports a single declared item (e.g., a large function, enum, or configuration object).

- **Modular-Object**  
  Exports a default object literal that groups closely related logic/readonly-values. Very handy as a namespace for stateless data/functions.

- **Inventory**  
  Exports multiple independent declarations, such as shared types or small utility functions.

- **Linear**  
  Executes a series of commands, often for setup or initialization.

You can see a full list of script examples [here](Script-Examples.md).

<a id="file-organization"></a>
## 🗂️ File Organization

I would generally recommend breaking large files into `index.ts`, `types.ts`, and `constant.ts` files and group them together in a folder. This isn't always practical and probably is unnecessary for smaller files; however, all files large and small should still be organized into clearly defined regions:

1. Constants  
2. Types  
3. Setup / Execution  
4. Components (`.jsx` / `.tsx`)  
5. Functions
6. Exports  

Place `export default` at the **very bottom** of the file to make the public API immediately obvious.

Separate regions with:

```ts
/******************************************************************************
                        RegionName (i.e. Constants)
******************************************************************************/
```

Regions can be divided further into sections:

```ts
// **** Configured Functions **** //

const someConfiguredFn = createAsyncThunk(...do stuff);

// **** Function Declarations **** //

function getUserName(userId: number) { isValidUser(id) ...do stuff }
function getUserEmail(userId: number) { isValidUser(id) ...do stuff }
```

Comments in functions:
- Generally you should not put spaces in functions and separate chunks of logic with a single inline comment.
- If you have a really large function that can't can't be broken up (i.e. React Component or a linear script with a bunch of async/await line) the you can further separate functions with a space and `// ** "Info" ** //`

```ts
/**
 * Normal everyday javascript function.
 */
function normalFunction() {
  // Do stuff
  foo();
  bar();
  // Do more stuff
  blah();
  whatever();
}

// Lage self executing startup script that needs to be wrapped
// in and async function so we use away
(async () => {
  try {
    // ** Do stuff ** //
    foo();
    bar();
    ...several more lines of code

    // ** Do more stuff **//
    blah();
    whatever();
    ...several more lines of code

  } catch (err) {
    handleErrorObject(err);
  }
})()
```

## 🛠️ Core Language Features

<a id="primitives"></a>
### Primitives 

JavaScript primitives include:

`null`, `undefined`, `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `symbol`, and `bigint`.

Understand **type coercion**: when calling methods on primitives, JavaScript temporarily wraps them in their object counterparts (`String`, `Number`, `Boolean`).

`symbol` is particularly useful for defining unique object keys in shared or library code.

---

<a id="functions"></a>
### Functions

- Prefer **function declarations** at the file level to take advantage of hoisting.
- Use **arrow functions** for callbacks and inline logic.

```ts
function parentFn(param: string) {
  const childFn = value => doSomething(value);
  const childFn2 = (a, b) => doSomethingElse(a, b);
}
```

Use object-literal methods when `this` should refer to the object itself.

---

<a id="objects"></a>
### Objects

Objects are collections of key/value pairs created via:

- Object literals
- Classes
- Enums

Avoid legacy constructor functions (`new Fn()`) in favor of modern class syntax.

<a id="object-literals"></a>
#### `Object Literals`

Readonly object-literals are ideal for organizing related logic and are often preferable to classes.

```ts
export default {
  someFunction,
  someOtherFunction,
} as const;
```

<a id="classes"></a>
#### `Classes`

OOP can be achieved in TypeScript/JavaScript with classes or factory-functions.

People coming from strict OOP environments (like Java) tend to overuse classes, but they do make sense in some situtations. Here are some basic guidelines:

- **Use a class** when you have an object with an internal state that needs to be modified after instantiation.
- **Don't use a class** soley as a namespace or when you're **assembling and returning an object whose behavior is fully determined at instantiation** with no meaningful **lifecycle** or need for `this`. A **factory-function** would be more appropriate here.
- **Note:** I would also recommend avoiding **classes for handling IO data** (even when you feel tempted to use OOP), because this often leads to:
  - Many unnecessary **constructor calls** to support dynamic behavior, or
  - A large number of identical `public static` functions
  - It doesn't fit the mental model for classes because values on a data item could be handled outside the class representing it. 
    - For example, in `user.id` _id_ is probably set in the database not by the `user.setId()` function (unless copying it).
  - A simpler approach is to handle IO data using **modular-object scripts** and describing data items with **interfaces**.

You can see a more thorough list of design rules [here](Design-Rules.md). 

<a id="enums"></a>
#### `Enums`

Enums emit runtime JavaScript and are discouraged in modern TypeScript configurations because they generate additional code. Prefer **readonly objects** with **declaration-merging** intead:

```ts
const UserRoles = {
  BASIC: 0,
  ADMIN: 1,
  OWNER: 2,
} as const;

type UserRoles = typeof UserRoles[typeof UserRoles]; // 0 | 1 | 2

const basic: UserRoles = UserRoles.BASIC;
```

---

<a id="types"></a>
### Types

- Prefer `interface` for object shapes.
- Use `type` for unions, primitives, and utility types.
- Place type aliases above interfaces.

```ts
type Role = "basic" | "admin";

interface IUser {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  role: Role;
}
```

<a id="naming-conventions"></a>
## 🏷️ Naming Conventions

- **Folders**: `kebab-case`
- **Files**:
  - **Inventory / Linear scripts**: `kebab-case`
  - **Modular object / Declaration scripts**: name it after the item being exported
- **Readonly**:
  - **Primitives/Arrays**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  - **Objects**:
    - For object-literals used as a namespace for a collection of readonly values `PascalCase` for the object name and any nested objects and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for the keys.
    - If the entire object is a value being passed (it's not simply a namespace) and you can't choose the keys, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE is okay for the name. 
- **Variables**: `camelCase`
- **Functions**:
  - `camelCase`: most of the time
  - `PascalCase`: for certain situations
    - JSX Elements
    - Functions just meant to return static data or make simple insertions to static data (i.e. put a value in a string) can be `PascalCase`.
  - Prepend functions returning non IO-data with a `get` and IO-data with a `fetch` (i.e. `fetchUsers()`).
  - Prepend **validator-functions** with an `is`.
- **Classes / Types**: `PascalCase`
  - You can prepend an interface with an `I` for scenarios where you might have a type/value naming conflict: ie. `class Dog implements IDog`.
- **Booleans**: prefix with `is`

Notes for all:
- **Abbreviations** and **Acronyms**:
- This is not an exact science and abbreviations/acronyms should generally be avoided for clarity BUT there are plenty of exceptions:
  - Well-establish abbreviations (i.e. URL, API) and acronyms (i.e. Pwd, Req => Request) are usually okay.
  - Use **ALL CAPS** for well-established acronyms: i.e `insertIntoURL()`.
  - Avoid both when when doing `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` unless it's a well-establish acronym.
  - For a long variable-names that could be cumbersome to use, which persist heavily throughout your application, an abbreviation/acronym is probably okay; however, the core layer describing them (i.e. the database table and its interface) should refrain unless it's a well-establish acronym.
  - The more localized a name gets (i.e. just used once in a small function) the more you can abbreviate/"use-acronyms".

> The modular-object script [User.ts](User.ts) has some good examples on standard naming conventions.

<a id="comments"></a>
## 💬 Comments

- Place `/** */` above all function declarations.
- Use `//` for inline explanations.
- Capitalize and punctuate comments.
- Separate logical regions clearly.

<br/><b>***</b><br/>

<a id="imports"></a>
## 📥 Imports

- Group imports by origin: libraries → application → local.
- Split long import lists across multiple lines.
- For those your using prettier this can be configured automatically.

<br/><b>***</b><br/>

<a id="testing"></a>
## 🧪 Testing

- Unit-test all user-driven behavior.
- Developers should write their own tests.
- Integration tests should be focused and minimal early on.
- Tests improve readability as well as correctness.

<br/><b>***</b><br/>

<a id="organizing-shared-code"></a>
## 🤝 Organizing shared code
- In a directory with shared content create a subfolder named `common/`.
- Start off by adding the following files as needed
  - `utils.ts`: logic that needs to be executed (standalone functions or modular-objects)
  - `constants.ts`: readonly items
  - `types.ts`: types only no values
  - Depending on the nature of your project you could have more. A react app for example could also include:
    - `components/`
    - `hooks/`
- If any of these files becomes too large, create a folder of the same name, rename the file to `index.ts` and place it there along with its adjacent content:
  - `common/`
    - `constants.ts`
    - `utils/` <-- `utils.ts` grew too large so we separated it into `index.ts` and `StringUtils.ts`
      - `index.ts`
      - `StringUtils.ts`
    - `types.ts`
- If you have something that isn't shared but you don't want it to go in the file that it is used in for whatever reason create another subfolder called `aux/`and place it there.
  - `routes/`
    - `aux/`
      - `postToPdf.ts` <-- Only used in the `PostRoutes.ts` file but large enough to separate out.
    - `support/`
    - `PostRoutes.ts`
    - `UserRoutes.ts`
- Try to avoid giving folders names like `misc/`, `helpers/`, `shared/` etc. as these can quickly become dumping grounds.
- If `common/` or `aux/` are in a folder with a bunch of other folders and you want them flushed to the top of whatever IDE or file-explorer your using, you can prepend them with an `underscore` (i.e. `_common/`).

## 🍽️ Food for Thought

### Programming Paradigms
- To be clear, **OOP (Object-Oriented-Programming)** is a set of design principles not a specific language feature.
  - The four design principles are: **Inheritence**, **Polymorphism**, **Abstraction**, and **Encapsulation**
- The term **functional programming** has been used interchangeably between **procedural-programming** and **strict functional-programming** (stateless, i.e. Haskell).
- TypeScript supports OOP and is clearly not strictly stateless, so to avoid confusion, let's refer to TypeScript as a procedural programming language which supports OOP.
- Projects don't have to strictly adhere to one paradigm or the other, use procedural where procedural makes the most sense and likewise for OOP.
- OOP can be achieved either through **classes** or **factory-functions** although I prefer the former.
- You can see a more thorough list of design rules [here](Design-Rules.md) to help you decide what feature/paradigm to use and when.

### Documentation with _"comment-annotations"_ 
- A **comment-annotation** is keyword in a comment that starts with `@`.
- Use interfaces to describe the raw dabase structure.
- Place a `@Table: "tableName"` comment above the interface declaration.
- Try to create new types for variations of the raw database-type instead of appending properties the original.
- Although for simple/auxilliary tables an optional property is okay.
- Make sure to document foreign/primary-keys with comments (i.e `@PK` and `@FK`).
- I like to use `// @NaC` which stands for `Not a Column` to indicate properties which do not correspond to
a database-column:
- Use `@TestOnly` for items not meant to be used in production. 
```ts
// @Table: "users"
interface IUser {
  id: number; // @PK
  name: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

// This is setup in the service layer
interface IUserDTO extends IUser {
  associates: IUser[]; // Place this here instead of IUser
}

// This is a simple auxilliary table so appending entries not
// on the database table is okay.

// @Table: "user_avatars"
interface IUserAvatar {
  id: number; // @PK
  s3Path: string;
  userId: number; // @FK
  imageSource?: string; // @NaC
}

/**
 * @TestOnly
 */
function getDummyUser() {
  return {
  id: randomInt(10),
  name: 'John',
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date(), 
}
```

- For those of you using VSCode, there is the "Better Comments" extension so you can highlight this.
- Install "Better Comments" and put the following in `settings.json`:
```json
"better-comments.tags": [
    {
        "tag": "@Table",
        "color": "#7FBF6A",
        "strikethrough": false,
        "bold": true
    },
    {
        "tag": "@PK",
        "color": "#7FBF6A",
        "strikethrough": false,
        "bold": true
    },
    {
        "tag": "@FK",
        "color": "#7FBF6A",
        "strikethrough": false,
        "bold": true
    },
    {
        "tag": "@NaC",
        "color": "#7FBF6A",
        "strikethrough": false,
        "bold": true
    }
]
```
